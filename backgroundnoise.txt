In this preview of my audio I have included five different
tracks that combine into background noise for my project.
The first track features the sounds of a book being slammed shut
and the pages being rustled through. The next track features
"crowd noise" specific to college library sounds and is fairly
loud. The third track is also library noise but is more general
and softer. This noise was also not recorded in a college library.
The fourth track is some face paced keyboard typing.
The fifth track is the sound of a backpack opening and closing.
All of these sounds contribute to the feel of being in a college
library for a multitude of reasons. First, the louder crowd
noise is meant to emulate the University of Pittsburgh's
first floor of the Hillman library. This is where my story
will take place because typically this floor is rather loud
because of the amount of group work that occurs there.
This noise is important to my story because the students in my
story cannot talk, therefore effectively avoiding work, without
being in an environment where they can be louder. In order to
make the distinction between any loud space and a library, I
had to put in other background noises as well. This is where
the backpack zipping, books slamming, and keyboard typing
become important. I did not want these background noises to be
overpowering, but it is important they are present in order
to alert listeners that these students are at a library,
specifically a floor that promotes socialization and group
work. The next steps I will work towards is adding the
card access sound to further distinguish that this is a library
on the University of Pittsburgh campus and add the core character
conversations into the story to help move the plot.
